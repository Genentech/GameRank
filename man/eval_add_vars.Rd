}
\arguments{
\item{ds}{Definition of (parallel) training:validation splits by a matrix 
with d columns containing 1s and 2s, where 1 denotes sample is used for 
training the model and 2 denotes sample used for validation.}

\item{dat}{data.frame or tibble comprising data for model generation 
and validation.}

\item{resp}{Character string defining the response (lhs) of the model formula.}

\item{vars}{Character vector defining the list of variables for selection. 
Those are concatenated by '+' as the right hand side (rhs) of the
 modeling formula.}

\item{fn_train}{Function with signature function( dat, resp, selection, ... ) 
that returns a model or NULL in any other case on the given data dat.}

\item{fn_eval}{Function with signature function( dat, resp, selection, ... ) 
that returns a real number or NA in any other case, e.g. when model is NULL.}

\item{maximize}{A logic value determining if fn_eval is maximized (set to 
TRUE) or minimized (set to FALSE).}

\item{selection}{Character vector of currently selected variables.}

\item{add_vars}{Character vector of variables that should be used to extend 
and evaluate selection.}

\item{...}{An other arguments passed to fn_train or fn_eval during calls, 
e.g. maybe 'u = 365' for Survival evaluations specifying the landmark day.}

\item{var_sep}{Character used to generated standardized string for selection 
by concatenation}
}
\value{
List with elements
\describe{
\item{df_evl}{tibble with all results from eval_split calls being concatenated}
\item{agg_evl}{tibble with aggregated evaluations by (ch_)selection and 
additional column 'added'. Best selections are flagged by 'opt'} 
\item{best_selections}{List of selections that were identified best on 
validation split.}
}
